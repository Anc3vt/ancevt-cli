/**
 * An InputStream implementation that allows manually pushing data (as lines or raw bytes)
 * to simulate user input, such as System.in in CLI or REPL environments.
 * <p>
 * Internally uses a blocking queue to hold bytes until they are read via {@link #read()}.
 * This makes it suitable for interactive applications, testing, and scenarios
 * where input must be fed programmatically in controlled fashion.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * PushableInputStream in = new PushableInputStream();
 * System.setIn(in);
 * in.pushLine("hello");
 * }</pre>
 * 
 *
 * <p><b>Thread safety:</b> the class is thread-safe â€” multiple threads can safely push data.</p>
